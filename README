simple bash script that goes through a directory, iterating its child
files and folders, ordered by a criteria you pick.

you can then do some actions with these files/directories
the idea is that you can clean up directories with minimal keystrokes

requirements: needs svn and git installed, and only supports these
obviously you are presented to open files with tools, and you want to do
that, you need them. (mplayer, xdg-open,..)
libui-sh

todo: tresholds and more stuff.
